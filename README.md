CS75 project 1 (C$75 finance):
fake shares trading site.

I've just found this course online:
	'Building Dynamic Websites
	Computer Science E-75
	Harvard Extension School'
And I decided to use those study materials.

To do:
Get real share prices from Yahoo finance site 
and simulate buying and selling those shares by authenicated users.
PHP, MySQL via PDO, Javascript with JQuery framework.
As I have already taken similar project in CS50 class 
(although I'm going to recreate it from scratch)
I will also add JSON and Googleâ€™s Visualization API.
Password (for almost all of existing users) is aA123.
PS.
I decided to use YQL for quotes (because it's newer way of making queries).
