# CS75 project 1 (C$75 finance):
fake shares trading site.

I've just found this course online:
	"Building Dynamic Websites
	Computer Science E-75
	Harvard Extension School".
And I decided to use those study materials.

To do:
Get real share prices from Yahoo finance site 
and simulate buying and selling those shares by authenicated users.
PHP, MySQL via PDO, Javascript with JQuery framework.
As I have already taken similar project in CS50 class 
(although I'm going to recreate it from scratch)
I will also add JSON and Googleâ€™s Visualization API.
Password (for almost all of existing users) is aA123.
PS.
I decided to use YQL for quotes (it seems more convenient).
PPS.
Work is done.
Web site has full functionality with Javascript enabled and
works well without Javascript (it won't show any charts or tables though).
I used different json queries just for studying purposes.
Some of them are realy slow (maybe it's because they're public 
and commercial queries shall be faster).
